<\b> Computer Vision Based Attendance System <\b>

This project is a face scanning attendance system which scans facial patterns and stores it with the student information to help mark attendance. 
Python's tkinter library makes up for our GUI while MySQL is used to store and fetch information. 
All student details and attendance records are written into CSV files.

During the pandemic, we were growing at an even faster rate in the technological field which leads us to the heavy reliance on the same. 
Whether it is in the corporate sector, entertainment, research or even education; day by day machines and technology play a bigger role in managing our mundane tasks.
While there are a lot of issues out there awaiting solutions, this project delivers a solution to a problem prevailing in the educational sector: attendance. 
It was always a task to take and update attendance of students, to only make it harder today by doing it virtually.

Spectrum is a real time face scanning application used to mark attendance for students through an online medium. The facial recognition system works on comparing facial biometric patterns of the face and matches with the patterns stored in the database. 
This database has been programmed to be accessed by the host to check the attendance and details of a specific student.

Spectrum estimates the problem and delivers the solution with utmost accuracy thanks to Adam Geitgey's face_recognition module which detects facial patterns even in non-ideal conditions.

While this project is quite deep in code, the execution is rather very simple. 

Just a 3-step process entailing – Image Capture, Image Training, Marking of Attendance, makes this project a very easy to understand project.
In addition, to really provide a spectrum of an experience, a search toolkit has been added to rectify/quickly search student details which provides an ease of access.

The primary windows of the system include:
